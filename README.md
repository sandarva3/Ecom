# Ecom

Ecom is an E-commerce website that offers a seamless shopping experience. You can freely add items to your cart, adjust quantities, and finalize your order. 
The main feature of this site is that you can perform these actions without creating an account. 
When you're ready to pay, simply fill out a quick form and make a payment, and your account will be automatically created. 
Your order will be placed through that account, and you can later log in to manage it. <br>
